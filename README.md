# Simple TODO List

Dumb todo list that I made, tags included, Early Access

## Features
- Todo with a tag to organize things
- Todos are saved via the device's cache to ensure they don't dissapear (and therefore haunt your device)
- Basic edit and deletion of a todo, as all todos should

## Things I might add
- search bar for todos, or by tags
- allow user to theme it
- option to set deadline on todo
- notifications

## That's it
